Title: Median-Supplement model based Classification tool for automated knowledge discovery
Version: 1.0.0
Maintainer:  Emmanuel S. Adabor <emmanuelsadabor@gimpa.edu.gh>
Description: Median-Supplement model based Classification implements a median-supplement approach to machine learning, supporting complete compliance efforts by never missing sensitive sub-datasets or allowing some sub-datasets to escape the classification process when balancing overall dataset as required in traditional classification models, for an automated and effective binary classification for optimal decision making.
